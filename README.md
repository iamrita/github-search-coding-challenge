# NYTimes Code Challenge

For the next phase of your interview process, we would like to see some of your Android coding
skills… Some technologies that we use at the NYTimes are Kotlin Coroutines, Dagger/Hilt and Jetpack
Compose. While the use of these tools would be preferable, please use whatever you are most
comfortable with or excited about. It’s most important to us to see your overall style and approach
to building and testing an application. At your interview, we will also discuss some of the
approaches and decisions and thought processes that were considered within your application.

# Build an app:

We'd like for you to build an Android application which allows a user to enter an organization name
and then displays the top 3 most popular (by stars) repository on GitHub for that organization. A
user should be able to click on one of the Repos and navigate to it within a webview or chrome
custom tabs.

You can find details on the API here: https://developer.github.com/v3/

Once you've completed the test, just zip up your solution and email or share it (via Google Drive)
back to me. Please include instructions to build and test.
